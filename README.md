# Sunday Stephen Abi — Founder of CaHoSa AI

## About Me
I am a microbiologist and infection prevention specialist working at the intersection of environmental microbiology, infection prevention science, and healthcare safety systems. I am developing CaHoSa (Care Home Safety) AI as a translational research initiative that applies microbiological risk modelling and patient safety science to predictive risk detection within care environments.

My work combines frontline healthcare experience, advanced microbiology training, and safety science to move care systems from reactive compliance toward proactive risk detection.



## Current Focus

- Predictive safety intelligence for care environments
- Infection Prevention & Control (IPC) modelling
- Healthcare risk analytics and decision support
- Responsible and clinically-informed AI development

## Scientific Basis

CaHoSa AI is grounded in established microbiology and infection prevention principles, including:

- Infection transmission pathways and exposure risk modelling
- Environmental and behavioural risk factors in care settings
- Infection Prevention & Control (IPC) surveillance logic
- Early detection and prevention aligned with antimicrobial resistance (AMR) priorities
- Systems-based patient safety and human factors approaches

The project is positioned as translational research, bridging laboratory microbiology knowledge with real-world healthcare implementation.

## CaHoSa AI

CaHoSa AI aims to:

- Detect emerging safety risks before incidents occur
- Support clinical governance and operational decision-making
- Improve infection prevention strategies using predictive modelling
- Reduce reactive incident reporting through early intervention insights
  
## How CaHoSa AI Works

CaHoSa AI is designed to combine:
- Operational signals (incidents, observations, audits, logs)
- IPC risk factors and domain rules
- Predictive modelling to estimate risk trends
- Decision support outputs (alerts, priorities, recommended actions)

Focus: proactive risk detection + safer decisions, not blame.

## Innovation Positioning

CaHoSa AI introduces a proactive safety intelligence model that shifts care environments from reactive incident reporting toward predictive risk awareness.

## Evaluation and Research Direction

The development of CaHoSa AI follows a research-informed approach:

- Identification of measurable safety indicators and IPC risk signals
- Pilot evaluation within care environment workflows
- Continuous improvement through audit cycles and evidence-based refinement
- Alignment with data governance, ethical practice, and responsible AI principles

The long-term aim is to support research into predictive infection prevention and proactive safety intelligence across healthcare systems.

Key innovation areas:

• Domain-informed AI combining microbiology, IPC expertise, and operational safety data.

• Predictive modelling applied to real-world care workflows.

• Decision-support designed for frontline usability rather than purely retrospective analytics.


## Proof of Work (Early Evidence)

- Project infrastructure established, including public documentation and core repository development.
- Public technical roadmap and documentation in progress
- Core repository established: CaHoSa-AI-Core
- Building toward prototype validation with care-environment use cases

## Scientific Background

- MSc Molecular Microbiology (experimental and antimicrobial research focus)
- MTech Environmental Microbiology
- Advanced Infection Prevention & Control training (Level 7)
- Applied translational experience as Infection Prevention & Control Champion within healthcare settings



## Vision

Building intelligent systems that improve safety outcomes across healthcare and care environments through data-driven prevention. The long-term goal is to support predictive safety intelligence across care systems, enabling earlier intervention and data-driven prevention.
