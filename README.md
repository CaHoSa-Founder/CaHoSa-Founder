# Sunday Stephen Abi — Founder of CaHoSa AI

## About Me

I am the founder of CaHoSa (Care Home Safety) AI, a clinically-informed predictive safety intelligence platform designed to support safer care environments through risk analytics, Infection Prevention & Control modelling, and AI-assisted decision support.

My work combines frontline healthcare experience, advanced microbiology training, and safety science to move care systems from reactive compliance toward proactive risk detection.



## Current Focus

- Predictive safety intelligence for care environments
- Infection Prevention & Control (IPC) modelling
- Healthcare risk analytics and decision support
- Responsible and clinically-informed AI development



## CaHoSa AI

CaHoSa AI aims to:

- Detect emerging safety risks before incidents occur
- Support clinical governance and operational decision-making
- Improve infection prevention strategies using predictive modelling
- Reduce reactive incident reporting through early intervention insights
  
## How CaHoSa AI Works

CaHoSa AI is designed to combine:
- Operational signals (incidents, observations, audits, logs)
- IPC risk factors and domain rules
- Predictive modelling to estimate risk trends
- Decision support outputs (alerts, priorities, recommended actions)

Focus: proactive risk detection + safer decisions, not blame.

## Innovation Positioning

CaHoSa AI introduces a proactive safety intelligence model that shifts care environments from reactive incident reporting toward predictive risk awareness.

Key innovation areas:

• Domain-informed AI combining microbiology, IPC expertise, and operational safety data.

• Predictive modelling applied to real-world care workflows.

• Decision-support designed for frontline usability rather than purely retrospective analytics.


## Proof of Work (Early Evidence)

- Brand infrastructure established: Primary domains secured (cahosa.com, cahosa.ai, cahosa.co.uk, cahosa.health)
- Public technical roadmap and documentation in progress
- Core repository established: CaHoSa-AI-Core
- Building toward prototype validation with care-environment use cases

## Background

- MSc Molecular Microbiology
- MTech Microbiology
- Level 7 Infection Prevention & Control
- Frontline IPC Champion experience



## Vision

Building intelligent systems that improve safety outcomes across healthcare and care environments through data-driven prevention. The long-term goal is to support predictive safety intelligence across care systems, enabling earlier intervention and data-driven prevention.
